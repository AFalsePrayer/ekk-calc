# Emerald Kaizo Kaizo calculator

The following is just an upload of all the work that you can find from https://github.com/AFalsePrayer/ek-calc/tree/ekk-calc, which is a fork from anastaraweh, with some visual updates designed specifically for EKK.

Notes:
- Will be adding a "Save Changes" button, similar to ForwardFeed's calculator.
- Will be changing the search function so that the user can search via trainer name and not just by Pok√©mon names, as demonstrated by KinglerChamp's vanilla calculator.
- Adding Gen 3 spritework to overlay.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter @afalseprayer for any concerns.
